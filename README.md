The intent of this subdirectory is for utilties for dealing with submissions
that have originated from black board (TODO possibly rename to black board?)

usernames
---------
Some helpful utilities for translating usernames and for generating a list of
usernames present

---------
For finding late submissions

For automating the actual grading process. Since often this process will vary
wildly by class/semester the folders are intially broken down by class (subject)
and may possibly be further broken down into semester.

eclipse
---------
Some general utilities for dealing with submissions in the form of eclipse
projects

rubric
----------
This directory really contains a general, class agnositic framework to grading
that heavily relies on the fact that you are running a \*nix platform

etc
----------
For current lack of a better place to put things.  This folder really just
contains general, and hopefully helpful utilities
