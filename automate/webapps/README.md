CSCI446: WebApps
================

My grading helper scripts for webapps (spring15).

Start by creating a directory structure like this:

    csci446/
      |- 01/
      |    |- username1/
      |    |- username2/
      |    |- ...
      |    |- usernameN/

Where *username1* through *usernameN* are usernames in your format of choice
from the student list on blackboard. Put `newassignment` in `csci446/`, and
sprinkle `gradehelper-XX` scripts in directories corresponding to their
units, as the semester progresses.
